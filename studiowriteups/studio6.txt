Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Question A1:

i = 0;   j = 0;
while  ( k <= m+n+1 ) do {
	if a[i] <= b[j] then {
		c[k] = a[i]
		k++;
		i++; 
		}
		else {
		c[k] = b[j]
		k++;
		j++; }
		
}
Question A2:
He is convinced.
Question A3:

Question A4:
Every time K++, I pick the next minimum out of array A and B so the invariant holds.
Question A5:
it is done
Question B1:
Theta(n)
Question B2:
T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n

Question B3:
Theta(n logn)
Question B4:
T(n) = kT(n/k) + n
Question B5:
theta(n log n)
Question C1:
The total scpace is 2n. 
T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n
O(2n)
Question C2:
We do not need array C, and use A + B as C. Every next minimum will be filled into A untill it is full and then move to B.
Question C3:

Question C4:
Swap until the heap properties hold.
Question C5:
Swap the root to the leaf ( last index of the array ) and let the heap properties run while doing it.
