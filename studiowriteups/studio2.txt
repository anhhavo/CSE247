Below each question, type in your short, to-the-point answers.

Question A1:
The function of n for ticks and time is a n^2 + 3n curve.
Question A2:
Every
Question B1:
The shape of running-time is now a straight line because we did remove the while loop with 2n*ticks.
Question B2:
INcrease by the tail
Question B3:
Having a tail pointer is worth when there is a very long list, and it is not worth when we have such as 1 element in the list.

Question C1:
3n + 3
Question C2:
We add a new variable so that everytime a new element is added, the variable increases by 1.
Question C3:
because calling a varialble is at theta(1) no matter how big n is.
Question D1:
The complexity is constant-time. 
Question D2:
Maintain the mid-point variable
Question D3:
Maintain a maximum variable as running through the list.
Question D4:
It does not change. a 2nd-maximum point can be maintained if we want to delete the maximum point.
