Question A2:



Question A3: 

Question B1:
Theta( n^3 ) 

Question B2:
It is Theta(n)
Question B3:
Theta(n)
Question C1:
2^n
Question C2:
The asymptotic behavior does not change.
Question C3:
The asymptotic behavior does not change even though there are more recurrence calls are done.
Question C4:
Since n_0 >0, the number of recurrences decrease, as well the problem size but the asymptotic behavior does not change.
Question C5:
